 * it can work with. From a practical standpoint, it should handle all
 * the sensors you're likely to connect to a single ESP.
 * 
 * @param pin The GPIO pin to which you have the data wire of the
 * 1-Wire sensor(s) connected.
 * 
 * @param config_path Currently not used for this class, don't provide
 * it - it defaults to a blank String.

/**
 * @brief Used to read the temperature from a single 1-Wire temperature
 * sensor. If you have X sensors connected to your ESP, you need to create
 * X instances of this class in main.cpp.
 * 
 * All instances of this class have
 * a pointer to the same instance of DallasTemperatureSensors.
 * 
 * Temperature is read in Celsius, then converted to Kelvin before sending
 * to Signal K.
 * 
 * It will use the next available sensor address from all those found by the
 * DallasTemperatureSensors class. Once a sensor is "registered" by this class,
 * it will keep reading that sensor (by its unique hardware address) unless you
 * change the address in the Config UI.
 * 
 * @see https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/tree/master/examples/thermocouple_temperature_sensor
 * 
 * @param dts Pointer to an instance of a DallasTemperatureSensors class.
 * 
 * @param read_delay How often to read the temperature. It takes up to 750 ms for the data
 * to be read by the chip, so this parameter can't be less than 800. If you make it less than
 * 800, the program will force it to be 800. You should
 * probably make it 1000 (the default) or more, to be safe.
 * 
 * @param config_path The path to configure the sensor address in the Config UI.
