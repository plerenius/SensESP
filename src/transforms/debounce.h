/**
 * @brief Implements debounce code for a button or switch
 * 
 * It's a passthrough transform that will output a value only if it's different
 * from the previous output, and only if it's been ms_min_delay ms since the input
 * was received, with no other input received since then.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of value being passed through Debounce.
 *
 * @param ms_min_delay The minimum amount of time that must have passed since
 * the input was received by this Transform in order for the output to occur. If
 * you are using this to debounce the output from `DigitalInputChange`, ms_min_delay
 * should be set at least a little bit longer than `DigitalInputChange::read_delay`.
 * 
 * DigitalInputChange::read_delay is 10 ms by default, and Debounce::ms_min_delay
 * is 15 ms by default. If that doesn't adequately debounce your button or switch,
 * adjust both of those values until it does.
 *
 * @param config_path The path for configuring ms_min_delay with the Config UI.
 * @see DigitalInputChange
